# Learning Management System (LMS)

This project is a simple and effective Learning Management System (LMS) designed to improve the efficiency of teaching and learning activities.  
The system supports multiple user roles, each with different responsibilities and access levels:

- Admin  
- Instructor  
- Course Creator  
- Student  

The main goal of this LMS is to centralize course-related activities, reduce manual work, and make it easier for institutions to manage courses and learners.

## Repository Information

This repository contains the source code for the LMS project.  
You can explore the code to understand:

- How different roles are implemented.  
- How course and user management are handled.  
- How the system flows from login to course usage.

## Future Scope (Optional Ideas)

Some possible future improvements that can be added to this LMS:

- Notifications for assignments, deadlines, and announcements.  
- Discussion forums or messaging between students and instructors.  
- Reports and analytics for admins and instructors (e.g., performance, attendance, engagement).  
- Integration with external tools or learning resources.
